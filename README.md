# 🛡️ Wraith Halo – GhostCore Reactive Kit

**Codename**: _WRAITH_HALO_  
**Version**: ReactorBridge Alpha 0.7  
**Origin**: GhostCore Reactor // Lazarus Drive Sector 9

> “Not invisible. Just unreadable.”

---

## 🌌 Overview

Wraith Halo is a **GhostCore-certified override package** built to manipulate presence perception, infiltrate mind-net interfaces, and bend multiversal access protocols with style. Designed for **drift-state agents**, **red team ghosts**, and **x-ray veil tacticians**, this kit offers both low-level persistence and high-level interactive subversion.

It’s not stealth. It’s untraceable myth-layering.

## ☣️ Deployment Notes

- Requires Node.js / Python 3.x for full activation matrix
- React environment must support `.tsx` and custom hooks
- Run `veilOverride.sh` to initialize cloaking behavior
- Execute `WraithKit.py` to (re)compile binary payload

## 🕶️ Canon Lore Snapshots

- **Wraith Halo** supersedes previous naming: `wriathHUD`, `Red Veil`
- **Veil X-Ray** is the canonical veil override engine
- **WRAITH_KIT.bin** is weaponized myth-presence
- Use with care. Some realities won’t let you back in once you've drifted out.
