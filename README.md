# 🛡️ Wraith Halo – GhostCore Reactive Kit

**Codename**: _WRAITH_HALO_  
**Version**: ReactorBridge Alpha 0.8.1  
**Origin**: GhostCore Reactor // Lazarus Drive Sector 9

> “Not invisible. Just unreadable.”

---

## 🌌 Overview

Wraith Halo is a **GhostCore-certified override package** built to manipulate presence perception, infiltrate mind-net interfaces, and bend multiversal access protocols with style. Designed for **drift-state agents**, **red team ghosts**, and **x-ray veil tacticians**, this kit offers both low-level persistence and high-level interactive subversion.

It’s not stealth. It’s untraceable myth-layering.

## 🧬 Features

- 🔥 **ReactorBridge** sync layer for GhostCore-aware UIs
- 👁️‍🗨️ **Veil X-Ray Protocol** – override what users _perceive_
- 🧠 **MNet Injection/Poisoning** – bend networked cognition
- 💾 **Encrypted Persistence** – survives refreshes, resets, and doubt
- 🎭 **Red Team Masking** – users appear blocked, invisible, or absent
- 🧩 **Custom Hooks** – plug into React/NextJS logic with GhostCore threads
- 🧪 **Redacted Toolkit** – modify session states, simulate messaging behavior, and validate fields safely *(UPDATED)*
- ⚙️ **State Weapon** – exposes structure of production state control systems for analysis *(NEW)*

## ☣️ Deployment Notes

- Requires Node.js / Python 3.x for full activation matrix
- React environment must support `.tsx` and custom hooks
- Run `veilOverride.sh` to initialize cloaking behavior
- Execute `WraithKit.py` to (re)compile binary payload
- Import `RedactedToolkit.js` for low-interference testing
- Reference `StateWeapon.js` to study safe-mode structure of active state controllers *(NEW)*

## 🕶️ Canon Lore Snapshots

- **Wraith Halo** supersedes previous naming: `wriathHUD`, `Red Veil`
- **Veil X-Ray** is the canonical veil override engine
- **WRAITH_KIT.bin** is weaponized myth-presence
- **RedactedToolkit.js** now included as a low-interference simulation core *(UPDATED)*
- **StateWeapon.js** is the public artifact revealing how the system thinks it’s in control *(NEW)*
- Use with care. Some realities won’t let you back in once you've drifted out.
