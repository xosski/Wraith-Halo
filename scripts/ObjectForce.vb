    const t = `\`${Pa}\` requires a description for the component to be accessible for screen reader users.

You can add a description to the \`${Pa}\` by passing a \`${LS}\` component as a child, which also benefits sighted users by adding visible context to the dialog.

Alternatively, you can use your own component as a description by assigning it an \`id\` and passing the same value to the \`aria-describedby\` prop in \`${Pa}\`. If the description is confusing or duplicative for sighted users, you can use the \`@radix-ui/react-visually-hidden\` primitive as a wrapper around your description component.
